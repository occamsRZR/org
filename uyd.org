    - Will need to move the server
      1) Decide on what setup
      2) Figure out provisioning and if it needs a refactor
      3) Figure out the costs pros/cons

      - not sure if it even makes sense to switch to CoreOS
	- seems like it's best suited to handle large clusters
      - might be good to use docker/dokku, though.
      - would be better used if I needed a large cluster :P
      - not going to use it
