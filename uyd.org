    - Will need to move the server
      1) Decide on what setup
      2) Figure out provisioning and if it needs a refactor
      3) Figure out the costs pros/cons
    - Will need to transfer off of S3
      1) Should probably use paperclip
      2) Look into using nginx streaming capabilities
      3) Look into scraping all of the current episodes as well

***** DONE Try out CoreOS locally with Vagrant and Docker		:rnd:
      CLOSED: [2014-11-18 Tue 20:33] SCHEDULED: <2014-11-11 Tue>
      - not sure if it even makes sense to switch to CoreOS
	- seems like it's best suited to handle large clusters
      - might be good to use docker/dokku, though.
      - would be better used if I needed a large cluster :P
      - not going to use it
**** TODO Try out a dokku setup						:rnd:
***** DONE Try out Dokku locally with Vagrant

	3) gitlab (pending)

      - Chimney Rock
      The native Lakota tribes called this erect rock "Elk penis". I thought it was only fitting 
    to include a dick pic in this inappropriate package (wanky, wanky).  You will also find some SciTy DVDs. 
    One of them details the life of this dick named "L. Ron Hubbard".  He was born in Tilden, Nebraska and 
    quickly grabbed the attention of the world with his bookcasts and invented this beatiful thing called
    "Dianetics".  You will also find one of the most offensive bumper stickers I've ever ran across.
    I picked it up about an hour away from Chimney rock in the town of Sidney, NE.  Your best bet might be
    hiding this away in a desk drawer, giving it away to a xenophobic friend, or putting it in your next 
    scrapbook.  Lastly, I have included a couple stickers from a dancecast I enjoy.  
    You might check it out sometime. 
    + Include other items
      1. UYD stickers
      2. SciTy DVDs
      3. Bumper sticker
