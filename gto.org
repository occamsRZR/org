*** DONE [#B] Decide on two options - Ending going with second option
    CLOSED: [2014-12-02 Tue 18:11]
    1. Continue with Ghost Destinations
       + Might require less work
       + Could require more complex by city searching
    2. Move events to be dependent of Destinations
       + This is probably going to be the best long-term solution
       + Will need to move current Event's destinations
	 - Looks like there are 236 Events with destinations
	 - Of those, 68 are occuring in the future
       + Looks like they've already started using this
       + Need to refactor front-end
	 - map to display location of event, not destination
	 - info box to display different fields depending on the address type
       + Need to have events that are tied to destinations in forms duplicate the address of the destination
*** DONE [#B] Move current event destinations's addresses into the event model
    CLOSED: [2014-12-04 Thu 13:26]
*** DONE [#A] Refactor front-end in displaying of the data
    CLOSED: [2014-12-04 Thu 13:26]
    1. City-wide
       - just display the ghost location
    2. Dest-tied
       - Just display the dest
    3. Only Address
       - Display event address
*** DONE [#A] Duplicate address/geolocation of destination into the event
    CLOSED: [2014-12-04 Thu 13:27]
    1. City-wide
    2. Dest-tied
    3. Only Address
